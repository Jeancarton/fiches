        <h1>THE GRAPES OF WRATH</h1>
        <h2>John Steinbeck, 1939</h2>
        
        <h3>Résumé</h3>
        <p>
            Tom Joad is out of jail after four years. Once, drunk, he had killed a man with a spade. He and former preacher Casy (he is no longer a preacher, as he always says) will go with the Joad family (Grandpa, Grandma, Uncle John, Pa, Ma, Rose of Sharon and Connie, Noah, Alfred, Ruthie and Winfield) to look for work in California, after being expropriated from their own land by the bank.<br />
            With millions of people, they are on the roads and in California, desperately looking for work, without enough to feed themselves. Living decently without anything, trying not to let the family fall apart (central position of Ma), leaded by the unofficial leaders : Ma and Tom (it should have been Pa or Uncle John).<br />
            Until Casy is brutally assassinated by cops, and revenged by Tom. Tom will flee and fight in the dark (see below the quote) defending human life and freedom against this revolting and deceitful californian organization.<br />
            "Majestic in its scale and moral vision; an eloquent tribute to the endurance and dignity of the human spirit".

            <em>It’s our land. We measured it and broke it up. We were born on it, and we got killed on it, died on it. Even if it’s no good, it’s still ours. That’s what makes it ours – being born on it, working it, dying on it. That makes ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.</em><br />

            <em>Then I’ll be all aroun’ in the dark. I’ll be ever’where – wherever you look. Wherever they’s a fight so hungry people can eat, I’ll be there. Wherever they’s a cop beatin’ up a guy, I’ll be there. If Casy knowed, why, I’ll be in the way guys yell when they’re mad an’ – I’ll be in the way kids laugh when they’re hungry an’ they know supper’s ready. An’ when our folks eat the stuff they raise an’ live in the houses they build – why, I’ll be there. See? God, I’m talking like Casy.</em><br />

            2020-05 : Although I had already read it at least twice in French, it was wonderful to read it again. This story is really powerful.
