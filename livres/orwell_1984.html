        <h1>1984</h1>
        <h2>George Orwell, 1949</h2>
        
        <h3>Résumé</h3>
        <p>
            Winston Smith lives in Oceania, in London, one ot the three superpowers of the world : Eurasia, Eastasia and Oceania. The three of them are totalitarian systems. Oceania is led by the mysterious and almighty Big Brother. Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, where he has to rewrite articles of past journals, so as to make the past coherent with the present. e.g. When Oceania stops being at war with Eurasia and is at war with Eastasia, all the newspaper have to be rewritten to pretend Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia.<br />
            This is a big trouble for Winston, who dares not saying it out loud. He really can't forget what he has known and is rewritten. By fear of the Thought Police though, he says nothing. He buys however a diary in a prole shop, and starts writing his thoughts. He know this makes him guilty and he might be caught by the Thought Police and sent to the Ministry of Love, to be tortured.<br />
            He falls in love with Julia, is contacted by O'Brien, a high ranked member of the Party, who pretends to be a rebels, member of a secret dissident organisation. Julia and Winston think they join this organisation, but O'Brien was in fact a traitor, true member of the Party, who has them captured by the Thought Police.<br />
            They are tortured, betray each other, and Winston finally surrender. At the end of the book, he loves Big Brother.<br />
            There are fantastic lines about Newspeak, the meaning of the sexual puritanism of the Party, the past, the philosophical foundation of the Party, which is idealism.

            The Mnistry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there was just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv and Miniplenty.</em><br />

            <em>The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act as a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic.</em><br />

            <em>'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well. It isn't only the synonyms; there are also the antonyms. After all, what justification is ther for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take "good", for instance. If you have a word like "good", what need is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just as well - better, because its' an exact opposite, which the other is not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of "good", what sens is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like "excellent" and "splendid" and all the rest of them? "Plusgood" covers the meaning; or "doubleplusgood" if you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already, but in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else. In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words - in reality, only one word. Don't you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.<br />
            A sort of vague eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of Big Brother. Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm.<br />
            'You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak, Winston,' he said almost sadly. 'Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak. I've read some of those pieces that you write in the Times occasionally. They're good enough, but they're translations. In your heart you'd prefer to stick to Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year?'<br />
            Winston did know that, of course. He smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not trusting himself to speak. Syme bit off another fragment of the dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:<br />
            'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thougt? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the Eleventh Edition, we're not far from that point. But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course, there's no reason to excuse for committing thought crime. It's merely a question of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won't be any need even for that. The Revolution will be complete when the langage is perfect. NEwspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'Has is ever occurred to you, Winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now?'<br />
            'Except -' began Winston doubtfully, and then stopped.<br />
            It had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'Except the proles,' but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox. Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.<br />
            'The proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'By 2050 - earlier, probably - all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, MIlton, Byron - they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will change. Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like "freedom is slavery" when the concept of freedom has been abolished?The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now. Orthodoxy means not thinking - not nedding to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'</em><br />

            <em>Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more imoprtant was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she put it was:<br />
            'When you make love you're using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy and you don't give a damn for anything. They can't bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-year plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?'<br />
            That was very true, he thought. There was a direct, intimate connection between chastity and political orthodoxy.</em><br />

            Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. (...)<br />
            'And what good was that?'<br />
            'It was no good, because I threw it away a few minutes later. But if the same thing happened today, I should keep it.'<br />
            'Well, I would'nt! said Julia. 'I'm quite ready to take risks, but only for something worth while, not for bits of oldnewspaper. What would you have done with it even if you had kept it?'<br />
            'Nothing much, perhaps. But it was evidence.'</em><br />

            <em>'What shall it be this time?' he said, still with the same faint suggestion of irony. 'To the confusion of the Thought Police? To the death of Big Brother? To humanity? To the future?'<br />
            'To the past,' said Winston.<br />
            'The past is more important,' agreed O'Brien gravely.</em><br />

            <em>The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In a sens it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-riddent. The best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.</em><br />

            <em>One question at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.</em><br />

            <em>'What are the stars?' said O'Brien indifferently. 'They are bits of fire a few kilometres away. We could reach them if we wanted to. Or we could blot them out. The earth is the center of the universe. The sun and the stars go round it.'<br />
            Winston made another convulsive movement. This time he did not say anything. O'Brien continued as though answering to a spoken objection:<br />
            'For certain purposes, of course, that is not true. When we navigate the ocean, or when we predict an eclipse, we often find it convenient to assume that the earth goes round the sun and that the stars are millions upon millions of kilometres away. But what of it. Do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy? The stars can be near or distant, according as we need them. Do you suppose our mathematicians are unequal to that? Have you forgotten doublethink?' (...)<br />
            The belief that nothing exists outside your own mind - surely there must be some way of demonstrating that it was false? (...)<br />
            'How does one man assert his power over another, Winston?'<br />
            Winston thought. 'By making him suffer,' he said.<br />
            'Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain.'</em><br />

            <em>It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered remembering contrary things, but those were false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it all was! Only surrender, and everything thing else followed. (...)<br />
            Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense. 'If I wished,' O'Brien had said, 'I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.' Winston worked it out. 'If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him do it, then the thing happens.' Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind: 'It doesn't really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.' He pushed the thought under instantly. The fallacy was obvious? It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there was a 'real' world where 'real' things happened. But how could there be succh a world? What knowledge have we of anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever happens in all minds, truly happens.</em><br />
