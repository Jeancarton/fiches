            Yes, your future depend on me. When I thrive, you thrive. When I falter, you falter… or worse. One way or another, your actions will determine your fate, not mine. I am Nature. I will go on.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>What is Nature ?</strong><br /><br />

            <strong>The environment</strong><br /><br />
            
            The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally on Earth.<br />
            The environment represents the whole ecosystem that a society depends upon for various services such as water, materials, food and energy. When we refer to the environment, we are really talking about a combination of natural ecosystem and human economy.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Environmentalism</strong><br /><br />
            
            Environmentalism is a philosophy, ideology and social movement that seeks to improve and protect the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities, and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature.<br />
            Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and improvement of the natural environment and critical earth system elements or processes such as the climate. It may be referred to as a movement to control pollution or protect plant and animal diversity.<br />
            It is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The origins of environmentalism</strong><br /><br />
            
            The earliest ideas of environment protectionism can be traced in 6th century BC in ancient India, with the symbiosis between all living beings and the five elements : earth, water, air fire, and space.<br />
            Arabic medical treaties were written during the 9th to 13th centuries dealing with environment.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Early environmental legislation in Britain</strong><br /><br />
            
            In British industrial cities, local reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand reforms. It was only under the impetus of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, that the 1956 Clean Air Act was passed. It caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people’s quality of life.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The first environmental movements</strong><br /><br />
            
            An early “Back-to-Nature” movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as John Ruskin, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns.<br />
            Systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The movement in the United States</strong><br /><br />
            
            It began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of Nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>In the 20th century</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1916, the National Park Service was founded by US president Woodrow Wilson.<br />
            The Sierra Club actions galvanized public opposition to building dams in the Grand Canyon and protected many other national treasures.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Post-war expansion : the sixties and the seventies</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1962, <em>Silent Spring</em> by American biologist Rachel Carson, catalogued the environmental impacts of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology.<br />
            The book’s legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. New pressure groups formed, notably Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth (US).<br />
            Protection of the environment also became important in the developing world, as in India under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi: peaceful methods of protest against deforestation (literally hugging trees, leading to the term “tree huggers”) were very influential.<br />
            Another milestone in the movement was the creation of Earth Day in San Francisco and other cities on 21st March 1970.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>21st century and beyond</strong><br /><br />
            
            Enviromentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as global warming, overpopulation, genetic engineering, and plastic pollution.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecology</strong><br /><br />
            
            Ecology addresses the full scale of life, from tiny bacteria to processes that span the entire planet. It is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. It has a focus on biodiversity : an important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. It is not synonymous with environmentalism. Ecologists seek to explain life processes.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecosystems</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1964, Eugene Odum, called “the father of modern ecology”, insisted that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”; and that therefore reductionist scientific methods cannot adequately explain living systems.<br />
            Within the ecosystem, species are connected. Ecosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms. They are always changing.<br />
            An ecosystem’s area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Life</strong><br /><br />
            
            Generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of th Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem.<br />
            Life : scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction.<br />
            According to the French thinker Edgar Morin, a living organization can only be understood as a function of a continual process of disorganization which degrades molecules and cells uninterruptedly as they are being reproduced.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The biosphere</strong><br /><br />
            
            Part of the Earth's outer shell within which life occurs. It is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.<br />
            Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecological resilience</strong><br /><br />
            
            Capacity of a systems to absord disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, identity, and feedbacks ; and it can also be the time required for an ecosystem to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation. Human activities can adversely affect ecosystem resilience (such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution). Disturbances of sufficient magnitude can profoundly affect an ecosystem.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Economic resilience</strong><br /><br />
            
            Inherent to the successful operation of a free market is specialization which is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity. This very act of specialization weakens resilience. This dependency reduces the ability of the system to adapt to these changes.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Human impacts on resilience : the example of agriculture</strong><br /><br />
            
            Feeding more than 7.8 billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources.<br />
            As a result of agricultural intensification, plant biodiversity is reduced.<br />
            This leads to a reduction in soil fertility and productivity.
            Interdisciplinary discourse on resilience now includes consideration of the interactions of humans and ecosystems via socio-ecological systems, and the need for shift from the maximum sustainable yield paradigm to environmental resource management.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Sustainability</strong><br /><br />
            
            Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Four pillars of sustainability : economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability. Sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimize negative impacts.<br /><br />
 
            Western industrial revolution tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. In the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the greenhouse effect.<br />
            Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. It can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.<br />
            The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced not only by consuming less but also by making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The impact of consumerism</strong><br /><br />
            
            The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecological footprint</strong><br /><br />
            
            The ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. The challenge is for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Overshoot day</strong><br /><br />
            
            Earth Overshoot Day marks the date we (all of humanity) have used more from Nature than our planet can renew in the entire year.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Sustainability economics</strong><br /><br />
            
            Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation: as communities grow, so the environment declines.<br />
            Sustainability economics represents : "ecological economics where environmental, ecological, social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis". Much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins.<br />
            Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant.<br />
            Green economy : improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.<br /><br />

            <strong>Nature as an economic externality</strong><br /><br />
            
            As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities, they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded.<br />
            The challenge of applying the concept of ecological resilience to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making. The specialization that is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity weakens resilience.<br />
            The economic importance of Nature is indicated by the use of the expression “ecosystem services” to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Gaia</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1979, James Lovelock, a British scientist, published <em>Gaia: A new look at life on Earth</em>, which put forth the Gaia hypothesis; it proposes that life on earth can be understood as a single organism. The Gaia hypothesis proposes that the Earth is a self-regulating complex system.<br />
            That system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.<br />
            The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The mythical Gaia was the primal Greek goddess personifying the Earth.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecopsychology</strong><br /><br />
            
            Ecopsychology seeks to heal the alienation between the person and the natural environment. Denying the relevance of nature to our deepest emotional needs is still the rule in our culture generally. In devastating the environment we are undermining a basic requirement of sanity.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The inherent rights of Nature</strong><br /><br />
            
            The traditional environmental regulatory systems regard Nature as property to be used for human benefit.<br />
            Rights of Nature is grounded in the recognition that humankind and Nature share a fundamental, non-anthropocentric relationship given our shared existence on this planet.
