            <strong>The overview effect</strong><br /><br />
            
            It transformed the astronauts’ perspective of the planet and of mankind’s place upon it. “The Over-view Effect” causes a feeling of awe for the planet, a profound understanding of the interconnection of all life, and a renewed sense of responsibility for taking care of the environment.<br />
            That was the first time I had ever seen the planet hanging in space like that. <br />
            One of the astronauts said: “when we originally went to the Moon, our total focus was on the Moon. We weren’t thinking about looking back at the Earth, but now we’ve done it, that may well have been the most important reason we went.” <br />
            It’s this dynamic, alive place that you see glowing all the time. <br />
            It was pretty obvious from those descriptions we are stardust…<br />
            (The astronauts) were at some very deep level… realizing their interconnectedness with that beautiful blue green ball. Free time is filled with what they call “Earth gazing”, just staring out at the Earth. The beauty of seeing Earth as a planet. The Earth is one system, we’re all part of that system… there is a certain unity and coherence. You do from that perspective see the Earth as a planet; you see the Sun as a star: we see the Sun in the blue sky, but up there you see the Sun in a black sky… The next natural evolution of understanding the life in space, that is the fact that the Earth is a spaceship, Spaceship Earth. The Overview Effect is simply the sudden recognition that we live on a planet and all the implications that it brings to life on Earth. <br />
            It looks like a living breathing organism, but it also at the same time looks extremely fragile…<br />
            Many of the great wisdom traditions of the Earth have pointed to what we’re calling “The Overview Effect”, that is to say, they have realized this unity, this oneness of all life on Earth and of consciousness and awareness. In non-western cultures, especially in Asia, the emphasis has always been on the realization that the self and the world are not separate from each other but that they’re really interconnected, that the individual self and the species as a whole is a manifestation of the larger whole. <br />
            As you go into your mind in a contemplative way, the sense of the living reality of the planet becomes obvious, you become more in tune with the natural world. <br />
            There’s going to be a greater and greater interest in communicating this idea because after all it’s key to our survival: we have to start acting as one species with one destiny. We are not going to survive if we don’t do that. We’re seeing very clearly that if the Earth becomes sick, then we become sick. If the Earth dies, then we’re going to die. A part of that is to come up with a new story, a new picture, a new way to approach this and to shift our behaviors in such a way that it leads to a sustainable approach to our civilization as opposed to a destructive approach. <br />
            We’re basically all living in this one ecosystem called Earth and everything that you do on one side of the ecosystem affects the other side and that is a new way for living for most of humanity. <br />
            It’s the oasis against the backdrop of infinity, this just enormous universe behind it. It’s placed perfectly from the Sun to take care of us.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>A pale blue dot</strong><br /><br />
            
            The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. It underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Nature is speaking : Julia Robert is Mother Nature</strong><br /><br />
            
            Yes, your future depend on me. When I thrive, you thrive. When I falter, you falter… or worse. One way or another, your actions will determine your fate, not mine. I am Nature. I will go on.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>What is Nature ?</strong><br /><br />
            
            For decades people have unquestioningly accepted the idea that we should preserve Nature in its pre-human state. The “Anthropocene” is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch, given how pervasive human influence has been over it. <br />
            25 years ago, environmental writer Bill McKibben said that climate change meant that every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man, then Nature was over. I think that Nature is anywhere where life thrives. <br />
            The Amazon: actually, people live there. They have a meaningful relationship with the landscape. They hunt. They grow crops. Maybe we should define “Nature” by the presence of multiple species, by the presence of a thriving life. <br />
            Plant species growing there (in towns too), supporting all kind of insect life. This is a kind of wild Nature right under our nose, that we don’t even notice. <br />
            This Nature, this kind of wild, untended part of our urban, suburban, agricultural existence. The wildlife is kept to a certain population size. It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched. <br />
            Only two children out of five spent time outdoors at least once a week. Why? The response of 61 percent was, “There is no natural areas near my home”. This is just patently false. Everybody lives near Nature. <br />
            A cool elevated railway that you can see from the ground in Philadelphia. This is completely autonomous, self-willed Nature. And it’s right in the middle of the city. This is really an ecosystem. <br />
            First, we cannot define Nature as that which is untouched. We have to let children touch Nature, because that which is untouched is unloved.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The environment</strong><br /><br />
            
            The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally on Earth.<br />
            The environment represents the whole ecosystem that a society depends upon for various services such as water, materials, food and energy. When we refer to the environment, we are really talking about a combination of natural ecosystem and human economy.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Environmentalism</strong><br /><br />
            
            Environmentalism is a philosophy, ideology and social movement that seeks to improve and protect the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities, and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature.<br />
            Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and improvement of the natural environment and critical earth system elements or processes such as the climate. It may be referred to as a movement to control pollution or protect plant and animal diversity.<br />
            It is an attempt to balance relations between humans and the various natural systems on which they depend.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The origins of environmentalism</strong><br /><br />
            
            The earliest ideas of environment protectionism can be traced in 6th century BC in ancient India, with the symbiosis between all living beings and the five elements : earth, water, air fire, and space.<br />
            Arabic medical treaties were written during the 9th to 13th centuries dealing with environment.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Early environmental legislation in Britain</strong><br /><br />
            
            In British industrial cities, local reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying environmental degradation and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand reforms. It was only under the impetus of the Great Smog of 1952 in London, that the 1956 Clean Air Act was passed. It caused a rethinking of the dangers of environmental degradation to people’s quality of life.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The first environmental movements</strong><br /><br />
            
            An early “Back-to-Nature” movement, which anticipated the romantic ideal of modern environmentalism, was advocated by intellectuals such as John Ruskin, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw. The movement was a reaction to the urban conditions of the industrial towns.<br />
            Systematic efforts on behalf of the environment only began in the late 19th century.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The movement in the United States</strong><br /><br />
            
            It began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as John Muir and Henry David Thoreau making key philosophical contributions. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of Nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>In the 20th century</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1916, the National Park Service was founded by US president Woodrow Wilson.<br />
            The Sierra Club actions galvanized public opposition to building dams in the Grand Canyon and protected many other national treasures.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Post-war expansion : the sixties and the seventies</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1962, <em>Silent Spring</em> by American biologist Rachel Carson, catalogued the environmental impacts of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology.<br />
            The book’s legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. New pressure groups formed, notably Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth (US).<br />
            Protection of the environment also became important in the developing world, as in India under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi: peaceful methods of protest against deforestation (literally hugging trees, leading to the term “tree huggers”) were very influential.<br />
            Another milestone in the movement was the creation of Earth Day in San Francisco and other cities on 21st March 1970.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>21st century and beyond</strong><br /><br />
            
            Enviromentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as global warming, overpopulation, genetic engineering, and plastic pollution.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecology</strong><br /><br />
            
            Ecology addresses the full scale of life, from tiny bacteria to processes that span the entire planet. It is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. It has a focus on biodiversity : an important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. It is not synonymous with environmentalism. Ecologists seek to explain life processes.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecosystems</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1964, Eugene Odum, called “the father of modern ecology”, insisted that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”; and that therefore reductionist scientific methods cannot adequately explain living systems.<br />
            Within the ecosystem, species are connected. Ecosystems are dynamically interacting systems of organisms. They are always changing.<br />
            An ecosystem’s area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Life</strong><br /><br />
            
            Generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of th Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem.<br />
            Life : scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction.<br />
            According to the French thinker Edgar Morin, a living organization can only be understood as a function of a continual process of disorganization which degrades molecules and cells uninterruptedly as they are being reproduced.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The biosphere</strong><br /><br />
            
            Part of the Earth's outer shell within which life occurs. It is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.<br />
            Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecological resilience</strong><br /><br />
            
            Capacity of a systems to absord disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, identity, and feedbacks ; and it can also be the time required for an ecosystem to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation. Human activities can adversely affect ecosystem resilience (such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution). Disturbances of sufficient magnitude can profoundly affect an ecosystem.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Economic resilience</strong><br /><br />
            
            Inherent to the successful operation of a free market is specialization which is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity. This very act of specialization weakens resilience. This dependency reduces the ability of the system to adapt to these changes.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Human impacts on resilience : the example of agriculture</strong><br /><br />
            
            Feeding more than 7.8 billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth’s resources.<br />
            As a result of agricultural intensification, plant biodiversity is reduced.<br />
            This leads to a reduction in soil fertility and productivity.
            Interdisciplinary discourse on resilience now includes consideration of the interactions of humans and ecosystems via socio-ecological systems, and the need for shift from the maximum sustainable yield paradigm to environmental resource management.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Sustainability</strong><br /><br />
            
            Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Four pillars of sustainability : economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability. Sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimize negative impacts.<br /><br />
 
            Western industrial revolution tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. In the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the greenhouse effect.<br />
            Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. It can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.<br />
            The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced not only by consuming less but also by making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The impact of consumerism</strong><br /><br />
            
            The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecological footprint</strong><br /><br />
            
            The ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. The challenge is for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Overshoot day</strong><br /><br />
            
            Earth Overshoot Day marks the date we (all of humanity) have used more from Nature than our planet can renew in the entire year.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Sustainability economics</strong><br /><br />
            
            Historically there has been a close correlation between economic growth and environmental degradation: as communities grow, so the environment declines.<br />
            Sustainability economics represents : "ecological economics where environmental, ecological, social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis". Much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins.<br />
            Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a steady state economy in which total GDP remains more or less constant.<br />
            Green economy : improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Sustainability - Full documentary</strong><br /><br />
            
            <em>The Neolithic Revolution</em><br />
            The shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture led to permanent settlements, the establishment of social classes, the eventual rise of urban living and large civilizations. Before the modern era, people were very much aware of their environmental, physical and biological limitations: the amount of land that each family could cultivate was limited by the large amount of human or animal labor that was necessary for agriculture. <br />
            <em>The Modern Era</em><br />
            With a shift from a dominant pre-modern religious vision of the world to a modern scientific view came a whole new way of seeing the natural environment. <br />
            <em>The Industrial Revolution</em><br />
            The Industrial Revolution represented a radical dislocation between society and the ecosystem. Farm sizes and worker productivity increased dramatically. The mass of society moved from working the land into the newly industrializing urban centers. A major part of this changing dynamic was due to the harnessing of powerful new energy sources. Coal, oil and gas enabled the transition to new mass manufacturing processes as they shifted from manual to mechanical. <br />
            Extraordinary exponential growth of human economic activity that began in the mid-20th century. All indicators for economy and ecosystem started changing at an exponential rate (from population growth to loss of species to energy consumption). <br />
            <em>The Anthropocene</em>Human industrial activity has become the primary driver of changes within earth systems. Unprecedented scale of alteration to Earth’s core systems such as overall biodiversity, climate or ocean acidity. Because of human intervention in the biosphere, it can no longer stabilize itself within the same equilibrium that has benefited societies in the past. The global economy is now the primary driver of change within ecosystems. <br />
            <em>Sustainability</em><br />
            Sustainability then defines the ability of a system or process to endure over a period of time. How sustainable something is can be understood in terms of its overall efficiency in terms of how effective the whole organization is at operating within its environment. Sustainability is not a property of a thing. Sustainability is more what we call an emergent feature of whole systems. It is not so much about the parts as how the parts work together to enable effective overall outcomes. <br />
            An electric car is not really sustainable if the power system it is running on imports coal. <br />
            It is precisely because sustainability is about a relationship between a whole system and its environment that it cannot be achieved through optimizing individual parts. Sustainability is a complex and holistic challenge. It is the value and integrity of the whole organization that is required to maintain sustainability over time.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Nature as an economic externality</strong><br /><br />
            
            As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities, they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded.<br />
            The challenge of applying the concept of ecological resilience to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making. The specialization that is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity weakens resilience.<br />
            The economic importance of Nature is indicated by the use of the expression “ecosystem services” to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Gaia</strong><br /><br />
            
            In 1979, James Lovelock, a British scientist, published <em>Gaia: A new look at life on Earth</em>, which put forth the Gaia hypothesis; it proposes that life on earth can be understood as a single organism. The Gaia hypothesis proposes that the Earth is a self-regulating complex system.<br />
            That system as a whole, called Gaia, seeks a physical and chemical environment optimal for contemporary life.<br />
            The idea of the Earth as an integrated whole, a living being, has a long tradition. The mythical Gaia was the primal Greek goddess personifying the Earth.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>Ecopsychology</strong><br /><br />
            
            Ecopsychology seeks to heal the alienation between the person and the natural environment. Denying the relevance of nature to our deepest emotional needs is still the rule in our culture generally. In devastating the environment we are undermining a basic requirement of sanity.<br /><br />
            
            <strong>The inherent rights of Nature</strong><br /><br />
            
            The traditional environmental regulatory systems regard Nature as property to be used for human benefit.<br />
            Rights of Nature is grounded in the recognition that humankind and Nature share a fundamental, non-anthropocentric relationship given our shared existence on this planet.
