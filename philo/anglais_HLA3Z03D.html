            <li>Nature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. The word "Nature" is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Environment / Environmentalism (écologisme)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally on Earth.<br />
            Environmentalism is a political and ethical movement that seeks to improve and protect the quality of the nantural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities, and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecology addresses the full scale of life, from tiny bacteria to processes that span the entire planet. Il is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. It is not synonymous with environmentalism. Ecologists seek to explain life processes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>History</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecology has a complex origin. Early conceptions of ecology such as balance and regulation in nature can be traced to the Ancient Greeks. Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developped in the 1700s. The Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modern Ecology : Ecosystems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" Eugene Odum, 1964. An ecosystem includes all the organisms in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure. The trophic structure is the food chain : within the ecosystem, species are connected.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wilderness / Life</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of th Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem.<br />
            Life : scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The biosphere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Part of the Earth's outer shell within which life occurs. It is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including theri interaction xith the elements of the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Humans and their environment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Homo sapiens have emerged about 200 000 years ago in Ethiopia. The advent of Homo was traditionally taken to coicide with the first use of stone tools. Il also coicide roughly with the onset of the begining of the current ice age. Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living bionass on Earth, the human effect is disproportionately large.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beauty in nature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Nature, lie art, only becomes meaningful when we make an active connection with it. Primitive men were completely immersed in nature, they depended on it much more than we do.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecological resilience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Capacity of a systems to absord disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, identity, and feedbacks ; and it can also be the time required for an ecosystem to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation. Human activities can adversely affect ecosystem resilience (such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution). Disturbances of sufficient magnitude can profoundly affect an ecosystem.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainability (developpement durable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Four pillards of sustainability : economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability. Sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimize negative impacts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>History of sustainability (histoire de la durabilité)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Western industrial revolution tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. In the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the greenhouse effect.<br />
            Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. It can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helix of sustainability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced not only by consuming less but also by making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecological footprint</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. The challenge is for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainability economics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sustainability economics represents : "ecological economics where environmental, ecological, social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis". Much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins. Green economy : improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.

            <li>Nature as an economic externality / The flaw of free market</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities, they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded.<br />
            The challenge of applying the concept of ecological resilience to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making. The specialization that is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity weakens resilience.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Human relationship to Nature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Social ecology is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Deep ecologists advocate policies for economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the quality of life rather than the standard of living.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Anthropocene</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Epoch dating when human activities started to have such a significant global impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems that it constitutes a new geological epoch for its lithosphere.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecopsychology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecopsychology seeks to heal the alienation between the person and the natural environment. Denying the relevance of nature to our deepest emotional needs is still the rule in our culture generally. In devstating the environment we are undermining a basic requirement of sanity.

        <h3>Commentaire sur Walden</h3>
        <p>
            American transcendentalism : <br />
            - neo-platonism with the belief that spirit is supreme over matter and the belief that which is given t us through the five senses.<br />
            - British romancy and its emphasis on the primacy of the individual over society. Nature is to be reverenced.<br />
            - The right of individuals to pursue truth as they see it.
            <br /><br />
            
            <strong>I - To wake my neighbours up!</strong><br />
            Walden is a bewitching, stimulating and obsessive text, full of live and energy. THoreau's message is not one of despair, but one of hope and optimism.<br />
            His decision to live in the woods is not owed to renouncement, but on the contrary to a desire to embrace life to the fullest, in all aspects.<br />
            <em>His labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine.</em> Ch I<br />
            It is not merely a record of two years in the woods, but also icludes a reflection on that experience. Walden has been called "a literary patchwork" because it interweaves close natural observations, personal experience and philosophical as well as practical considerations.<br />
            <em>The finest quality of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.</em> This poetic metaphore denounces the fact that Thoreau's contemporaries unecessarily devoted excessive time and energy to pursuits that did not fill their true needs, neglecting more essential aspects of their lives.<br />
            Thoreau's most famous words : <em>The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.</em> The Transcendentalists advocated self-reliance and optimism and encouraged listening to one's inner voice.<br />
            <em>Most of the luxuries are positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind</em>. Luxuries are "positive" obstacles to the elevation of human beings, meaning that they doubtlessly interfere with spiritual progress.<br />
            His guiding principle has been <em>to toe (the) line</em> of the present moment, that is live in the present moment, which is all spiritual guides recommend: the past is... past and the future does not existe yet.<br />
            Thoreau does not see the point in investing so much in these inventions : <em>We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas...</em> What is the point of technical progress if it does not advance intellectual or moral progress ? Thoreau is in fact profoundly interested in technology and invention. However, he saw the potential for destruction of nature for the ends of commerce and thought that the cultivation of the mind would be time much better spent.<br />
            The narrator's defiance of modernization is illustrated in the chapter "Sounds", the railway apocalyptically crosses the nature.
            <br /><br />
            
            <strong>II - Open your eyes</strong><br />
            Thoreau is at one with Nature: he absorbs it, incorporates it and fuses with it: <em>The landscape radiated from me.</em><br />
            If there was one reason for him to own land, it is only that it would enable him to protect nature from human intervention and let it reassert itself.<br />
            The shelter Thoreau has built for himself is not an obstacle to natural processes:physical phenomena and the laws of physics may result in drafts and humidity in the cabin, but what Thoreau detects is that: <em>The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted.</em> Through his observation, understanding and acceptance of natural phenomena, man is given access to a higher dimension.<br />
            At once explorer and a time traveler, he perceives, literally, that the infinite is at his doorstep, within reach, quiet, pure and pristine: <em>I discovered that my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn, but forever new and unprofaned, part of the universe.</em><br />
            Every morning is a spiritual dawn. <em>The Vedas (the oldest sacred books of the Hindus) say, "All intelligences awake in the morning."</em> The heroic quality os the morning spreads to the rest of the day. Those who are fully awake are not subjected to the passing of time.<br />
            The poet invites the reader to share in his liberation from conventions, blindness and self-deception.<br />
            <em>Still we live meaningly, like ants... Our life is frittered away by detail.</em><br />
            <em>Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!</em> Thoreau urges us to "simplify" in order to access the essential.<br />
            <em>Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is fabulous.</em> Not only do we cling to our illusions, bu tto access the true nature of reality is all the more difficult as society presents us with a distorted image of it.<br />
            <em>Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains.</em> In simple words, Thoreau reveals how deeply he feels that he is part of Nature. He absorbs life, he "drinks at it". The coarse "intellect" destroys the essence of living things as it cuts into reality, whereas the poet's "instinct" enables him to grasp the true nature of reality.
            <br /><br />
            
            <strong>III - Mother Nature</strong><br />
            <em>To feel this faint jerk, which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to Nature again.</em> The poet "spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight" experiencing transcendence through the aweinspiring beauty of the night sky.<br />
            Thoreau emphasizes how, in its inherent benevolence, Nature is forgiving:atoning for human errors, it regenerates itself, as epitomized by his beloved Pond. <em>Nature continually repairs; no storms, no dust, can dim its surface ever fresh.</em><br />
            (About the lake) <em>It is earth's eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature.</em> That eye watches over man with motherly solicitude and is also an opening onto man's inner world.<br />
            Metaphorically, Walden gives birth to the narrator.<br />
            Humans are unworthy of nature: as Thoreau sadly asserts at the end of the end of the chapter, <em>nature has no human inhabitants who appreciate her.</em><br />
            The sight of Walden is like a blessing which redeems even the non-believers, like a heavenly apparition: it cleanses, refreshes.<br />
            Thoreau vents his anger at Flint, a farmer who gave his name to a pod simply because <em>(his) farm abutted on this sky water</em>. The dull farmer is "stupid", literally meaning "in a state of stupor", of mental torpor, the opposite of Thoreau's ideal of man (<em>to be awake is to be alive</em> Ch 2). The <em>likeminded neighbor or legislature</em> mindlessly gave Flint a right to name the pond after himself, as he would a bride he was not worthy of. The law od God is trampled by Flint and by society alike.<br />
            <em>Give me the poverty that enjoys true wealth.</em><br />
            Over a century before the concept of th externality of Nature was enunciated, Thoreau remarks that the ponds have no "market value".<br />
            Seemingly unthinking nature could set an example of kindness, good faith and innocence for humans to emulate: <em>We never learned meanness of them.</em>
            <br /><br />
            
            <strong>IV - Conclusion</strong><br />
            <em>The true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little star-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.</em> To be materially successful is not a sign of personal value; what matters is achieving happiness. Thoreau insists that his experience is "intangible and indescribable", impalpable and impossible to convey in words.
