        <h3>Vocabulaire</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Nature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. The word "Nature" is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or wilderness.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Environment / Environmentalism (écologisme)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The natural environment encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally on Earth.<br />
            Environmentalism is a political and ethical movement that seeks to improve and protect the quality of the nantural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities, and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecology addresses the full scale of life, from tiny bacteria to processes that span the entire planet. Il is the study of how organisms interact with each other and their environment. It is not synonymous with environmentalism. Ecologists seek to explain life processes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>History</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecology has a complex origin. Early conceptions of ecology such as balance and regulation in nature can be traced to the Ancient Greeks. Ecological concepts such as food chains, population regulation, and productivity were first developped in the 1700s. The Origin of Species (1859) by Charles Darwin.

        <ul>
            <li>Modern Ecology : Ecosystems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" Eugene Odum, 1964. An ecosystem includes all the organisms in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure. The trophic structure is the food chain : within the ecosystem, species are connected.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wilderness / Life</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of th Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem.<br />
            Life : scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The biosphere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Part of the Earth's outer shell within which life occurs. It is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including theri interaction xith the elements of the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Humans and their environment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Homo sapiens have emerged about 200 000 years ago in Ethiopia. The advent of Homo was traditionally taken to coicide with the first use of stone tools. Il also coicide roughly with the onset of the begining of the current ice age. Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living bionass on Earth, the human effect is disproportionately large.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beauty in nature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Nature, lie art, only becomes meaningful when we make an active connection with it. Primitive men were completely immersed in nature, they depended on it much more than we do.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecological resilience</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Capacity of a systems to absord disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, identity, and feedbacks ; and it can also be the time required for an ecosystem to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation. Human activities can adversely affect ecosystem resilience (such as deforestation, overfishing, pollution). Disturbances of sufficient magnitude can profoundly affect an ecosystem.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainability (developpement durable)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Four pillards of sustainability : economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability. Sustainability implies responsible and proactive decision-making and innovation that minimize negative impacts.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>History of sustainability (histoire de la durabilité)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Western industrial revolution tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. In the 21st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by the greenhouse effect.<br />
            Sustainability is studied and managed over many scales of time and space and in many contexts of environmental, social and economic organization. It can entail the full compass of biological and human activity or any part of it.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helix of sustainability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The underlying driver of direct human impacts on the environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced not only by consuming less but also by making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecological footprint</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The ecological footprint measures human consumption in terms of the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. The challenge is for countries to maintain an acceptable standard of living for their citizens while, at the same time, maintaining sustainable resource use. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainability economics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sustainability economics represents : "ecological economics where environmental, ecological, social, cultural, health-related and monetary/financial aspects have to be integrated into the analysis". Much broader than the concepts of sustained yield of welfare, resources, or profit margins. Green economy : improves human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities. It takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nature as an economic externality / The flaw of free market</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities, they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded.<br />
            The challenge of applying the concept of ecological resilience to the context of sustainable development is that it sits at odds with conventional economic ideology and policy making. The specialization that is required to achieve efficiency and increase productivity weakens resilience.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Human relationship to Nature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Social ecology is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Deep ecologists advocate policies for economic, technological, and ideological structures that will improve the quality of life rather than the standard of living.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Anthropocene</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Epoch dating when human activities started to have such a significant global impact on Earth's geology and ecosystems that it constitutes a new geological epoch for its lithosphere.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ecopschology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Ecopsychology seeks to heal the alienation between the person and the natural environment. Denying the relevance of nature to our deepest emotional needs is still the rule in our culture generally. In devstating the environment we are undermining a basic requirement of sanity.

        <h3>Commentaire sur Walden</h3>
        <p>
            2019-05 : Constituendi autem sunt qui sint in amicitia fines et quasi termini diligendi. De quibus tres video sententias ferri, quarum nullam probo, unam, ut eodem modo erga amicum adfecti simus, quo erga nosmet ipsos, alteram, ut nostra in amicos benevolentia illorum erga nos benevolentiae pariter aequaliterque respondeat, tertiam, ut, quanti quisque se ipse facit, tanti fiat ab amicis.
